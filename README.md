### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1.  The populateFigures() function changes the src attribute values of the img elements and then allows you to create a for-loop.
2. The DOM method adds the feature to the Photo Gallery App that will give users the option to add two additional images to the screen so users can: see parts of all the images in the slideshow at once and use the buttons to navigate to any image they want to view
3. Attaching Nodes: A node you create with the createElement() method is not automatically attached to the DOM tree or to any other nodes. Instead, it exists independently of the DOM tree. The Document object includes several methods for attaching nodes to the DOM tree.
